# Mario Pest Control

Website with animations and sound to gamify tracking Mario's
"earnings" from eliminating various pests.

The site is made responsive using Bootstrap, animated with CSS3 
keyframes, and uses jQuery to capture user mouse and keyboard inputs, calculate real-time coin totals, and animate the buttons, baddies, and coin totals. 

A light/dark mode button is also included to toggle the overall
color theme of the page.
